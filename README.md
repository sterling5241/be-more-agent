This project turns a Raspberry Pi into a fully functional, conversational AI agent. Unlike cloud-based assistants, this agent runs **100% locally** on your device. It listens for a wake word, processes speech, "thinks" using a local Large Language Model (LLM), and speaks back with a low-latency neural voice—all while displaying reactive face animations.

**It is designed as a blank canvas:** You can easily swap the face images and sound effects to create your own character!

## ✨ Features

* **100% Local Intelligence**: Powered by **Ollama** (LLM) and **Whisper.cpp** (Speech-to-Text). No API fees, no cloud data usage.
* **Open Source Wake Word**: Wakes up to your custom model using **OpenWakeWord** (Offline & Free). No access keys required.
* **Hardware-Aware Audio**: Automatically detects your microphone's sample rate and resamples audio on the fly to prevent ALSA errors.
* **Smart Web Search**: Uses DuckDuckGo to find real-time news and information when the LLM doesn't know the answer.
* **Reactive Faces**: The GUI updates the character's face based on its state (Listening, Thinking, Speaking, Idle).
* **Fast Text-to-Speech**: Uses **Piper TTS** for low-latency, high-quality voice generation on the Pi.
* **Vision Capable**: Can "see" and describe the world using a connected camera and the **Moondream** vision model.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

* **Raspberry Pi 5** (Recommended) or Pi 4 (4GB RAM minimum)
* USB Microphone & Speaker
* LCD Screen (DSI or HDMI)
* Raspberry Pi Camera Module

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure your Raspberry Pi OS is up to date.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git -y
```

### 2. Install Ollama
This agent relies on [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run the brain.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh| sh
```
*Pull the required models:*
```bash
ollama pull gemma:2b
ollama pull moondream
```

### 3. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent.git
cd be-more-agent
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
*The setup script will install system libraries, create necessary folders, download Piper TTS, and set up the Python virtual environment.*

### 4. Configure the Wake Word
The setup script downloads a default wake word ("Hey Jarvis"). To use your own:
1. Train a model at [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord).
2. Place the `.onnx` file in the root folder.
3. Rename it to `wakeword.onnx`.

### 5. Run the Agent
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agent.py
```

## 📂 Configuration (`config.json`)

You can modify the hardware behavior and personality in `config.json`. The `agent.py` script creates this on the first run if it doesn't exist, but you can create it manually:

```json
{
    "text_model": "gemma3:1b",
    "vision_model": "moondream",
    "voice_model": "piper/en_GB-semaine-medium.onnx",
    "chat_memory": true,
    "camera_rotation": 0,
    "system_prompt_extras": "You are a helpful robot assistant. Keep responses short and cute."
}
```

## 🎨 Customizing Your Character

This software is a generic framework. You can give it a new personality by replacing the assets:

1.  **Faces:** The script looks for PNG sequences in `faces/[state]/`. It will loop through all images found in the folder.
2.  **Sounds:** Put multiple `.wav` files in the `sounds/[category]/` folders. The robot will pick one at random each time (e.g., different "thinking" hums or "error" buzzes).

## 🗣️ The Custom BMO Voice

This project features a custom, locally fine-tuned text-to-speech model to make the agent sound authentic! 

When you run the `setup.sh` script, it will automatically download the compiled `.onnx` model and its `.json` configuration file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent/releases) and place them into a local `voices/` directory.

**Manual Installation (if you are not using setup.sh):**
1. Download `bmo.onnx` and `bmo.onnx.json` from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent/releases).
2. Create a folder named `voices/` in the root directory of this repository.
3. Place both downloaded files inside the `voices/` folder.
4. Ensure your `config.json` file points to the new model:
   ```json
   "voice_model": "voices/bmo.onnx"
---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **"No search library found":** If web search fails, ensure you are in the virtual environment and `duckduckgo-search` is installed via pip.
* **Shutdown Errors:** When you exit the script (Ctrl+C), you might see `Expression 'alsa_snd_pcm_mmap_begin' failed`. **This is normal.** It just means the audio stream was cut off mid-sample. It does not affect the functionality.
* **Audio Glitches:** If the voice sounds fast or slow, the script attempts to auto-detect sample rates. Ensure your `config.json` points to a valid `.onnx` voice model in the `piper/` folder.
If your custom BMO voice sounds incredibly deep, slow, or "demonic," don't panic! This is not an issue with the Piper installation or the setup script. It is almost always caused by a **Sample Rate (Hz)** mismatch between the model and the audio player.

Here is how to fix it:

**Fix 1: Match the Sample Rate**
By default, `agent.py` expects "medium" quality models and plays audio at 22050 Hz. If your custom model was trained at a different quality (like 48000 Hz or 16000 Hz), playing it at the default rate will stretch or compress the audio, severely altering the pitch.

1. Open your model's configuration file (e.g., `voices/bmo.onnx.json`).
2. Look for the `"sample_rate"` property and note the number (e.g., `22050`, `16000`, `48000`).
3. Open `agent.py` and find the line: `PIPER_RATE = 22050`.
4. Change that number to match the sample rate in your `.json` file.
5. Save the file and restart the agent.

**Fix 2: Check the Length Scale**
If the sample rates match perfectly, the issue might be the model's internal pacing setting.

1. Open your `voices/bmo.onnx.json` file.
2. Look inside the `"inference"` block for a setting called `"length_scale"`. 
3. Piper uses this to determine the speed of the voice. If this value is set significantly higher than `1.0`, it will stretch the audio and make BMO sound like a zombie. Lower it closer to `1.0` to speed the voice back up to normal.
